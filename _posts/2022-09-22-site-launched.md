Well, this is the start to this. this is where i will write about my life and think up random ways on how to improve myself.

Last night i managed to wipe my phone and lock myself out of my apple id as i wont get my number back from EE until friday afternoon so i am stuck unable to be able to install apps to my phone. so nice job fin!

Today is my apprentice college day where atm im learning HTML and CSS with adam, just made this site :)

Tonight my goal is to fix my door and relax.
